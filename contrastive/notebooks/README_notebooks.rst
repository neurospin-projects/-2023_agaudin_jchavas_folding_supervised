Notebooks Readme
################

Subfolders
==========

archives
--------
Where old notebooks are stored. They are either deprecated or highly linked to a specific publication.

methods
-------
These notebooks are related to tests or implementation of a method supposed to improve the pipeline.
Unlike in technical_tests, **these notebooks contains relevant results** that made us choose between
methods, or that showed the benefit of a method.

schiz_db
--------
These notebooks are related to the database schiz, which is the fusion of bsnip1, candi, cnp and 
schizconnect-vip-prague. They are used for analysis or preprocessing of that database specifically.

technical_tests
---------------
These notebooks are only used as tests to see if an implementation works as intended. It shouldn't 
contain any results that are scientifically relevant. They are kept as evidence that the methods work.

wandb_grid_searches
-------------------
These notebooks contain relevant analyses about the region supervised grid searches.


Individual notebooks
====================

(*) notebooks are the important ones, either by the results they contain or by 
the fact that they implement methods used by other programs.

03-analysis_effect_of_n
-----------------------
Analysis of the effect of the training set size and a faw other parameters (such as batch size).

bdd_analysis (*)
----------------
Notebook that loads a database generated by ``evaluation/generate_bdd.py``, where relevant information of
trained models is stored. Some analysis about the link between model performance and train data gyrification,
time efficiency or validation loss are then performed.

methods/check_svm_consistency
-----------------------------
Notebook to check if svm are consistent, i.e. if they converge and how fast.
This question was risen because of the highly fluctuating results of the whole
pipeline under a certain validation loss.

count_voxels (*)
----------------
Notebook to visualize information about gyrification for datasets throuigh the number of voxels in
a normalized space. This notebooks also contains codes to generate gyrification based subsets (like
the most or least folded subsets of a dataset).

fusion_schiz_bases
------------------
**/!\\ It has been moved to preprocessing instead of notebooks.**
Notebook to fusion bsnip1, candi, cnp and schizconnect in one database nammed schiz. Please look at 
the google doc nammed "Travail base de données schizophrène" for more information.

technical_tests/optimize_transforms
-----------------------------------
Notebook to compare and decrease computation time of SimCLR augmentations.

paracingulate_analysis
----------------------
Localisation of paracingulate (and proeminent ones) in the latent space.

technical_tests/test_scaling
----------------------------
Notebook to test which scaler to add before running the classification.

visualize_flanker_results
-------------------------
Notebook to generate the color map of brain sulci with anatomist ; used for grid search visualization.
